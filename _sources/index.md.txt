# Range-time-plot

Python package to plot range-time graphs and other properties of experiments with EISCAT mainland radars. 

A monostatic radar is assumed, meaning volume information is not included or plotted.

# Features
- Creates range-time-plot of an experiment with matplotlib
- Shows time when transmitter, receivers, receiver protector or calibration are on
- Shows transmitted phase code
- Shows frequency for different channels.
